<h1>The Best Movies According to Sparsh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>NASA explores the opportunities of finding Earth-like habitable planets by sending a team of researchers through wormholes when the Earth is gripped with a catastrophic famine.Travel through a blackhole and the idea of humans interacting in a 5 dimensional world including gravity and time is truly mind-boggling.</p>
<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>An astronaut is left behind during a manned mission on Mars when the spacecraft has to leave to escape a destructive storm on Mars.He explores the possibilities of survival of life on Mars through various experiments and then also ensures that he himself survives to be able to reach the spacecraft in time which is coming for its rescue.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A banker is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to a life term in prison.He befriends several inmates and also uses his financial knowledge to help the prison authorities in return for enjoying normal life luxuries.The movie gives goosebumps to the viewers when it is found that the protagonist escapes from the prison from which no prisoner has ever escaped and that too in such a hard-to-believe manner.</p>
